# Python scripts for data analysis

*By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet (last updated: May 23, 2018)*

## About this folder

This folder contains a variety of Python scripts you can use on the data collected by `SAGE` to 
plot various graphs highlighting the most notable caracteristics of each AS. Each script simply 
requires a *Dataset* text file which gives the ASes of interest, their classification (i.e. stub, 
transit or tier-1) and the date of the dataset/snapshot the script should use to compute its 
results.
